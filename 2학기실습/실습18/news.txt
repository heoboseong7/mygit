Dasharath Madkami said he found the animal when a strange sound woke him up at around 03:00 local time (21:30 GMT).
He raised the alarm to alert other villagers, who overpowered the reptile and tied it to a tree.
The panicky villagers initially wanted to kill the crocodile, but were dissuaded by the headman.
Local wildlife authorities eventually came and rescued the animal.
